# Installation Guide

Follow these instructions to install `pasejo` on your system.

## Using the pre-built binary

We provide pre-built binaries for every version of `pasejo`. You can download them from the [release page](https://github.com/metio/pasejo/releases) and extract the archive matching your local system. The binary is named `pasejo` and can be run directly from the extracted folder. Place it in your `PATH` to make it available globally in your shell.

If you need a build for a platform which does not exist in our release page yet, please open an [issue](https://github.com/metio/pasejo/issues) or use `cargo` to install `pasejo` on your system.

## Using Cargo

You can install `pasejo` using `cargo`:

```shell
$ cargo install pasejo
```

## Package Managers
